rehash is a utility to change file hashes.

Rationale:

some sites prevent posting media if a copy of that file already exists.
they (usually) do this by comparing the file hash.
altering the file will, with high probability, change the hash of the file.


Notes:

>currently there isn't a ton of error handling

>rehash changes metadata for files in order to change the hash without changing the file content:
  -rehash inserts a tEXt chunk (after the IHDR chunk) in .png files
  -rehash writes a UserComment in exif in .jpg / .jpeg files
  -rehash inserts a comment block (after the GCT if present) in .gif files
  -rehash writes a tag segment to the end of .mkv / .webm files


Usage:

rehash FILENAME1, FILENAME2, ...       will write to "rehash_FILENAME"
rehash -o FILENAME1, FILENAME2, ...    will overwrite to the original filename.


It is expected rehash will be used on small (1 - 25 MB) media files such as those commonly posted on sites like reddit or 4chan.
This isn't a hardcoded limit; only to say it isn't expected creating a copy of the file should be a problem.


It is only planned to support media types commonly posted.

Supported filetypes:
.png
.jpg
.jpeg
.gif
.mkv
.webm

Planned:
.mp4


Requirements:
python3
piexif (pip3 install piexif)

development is done on linux, support on windows and mac is untested.


Test Files:
  >files in the test folder were used for testing.
  >they're random files i could find and test with for each filetype supported.
  >NOTE that test.webm shows errors when checked with mkvalidator:
    -https://www.matroska.org/downloads/mkvalidator.html
    -running rehash does not increase the error count on the output file
  >the mkv sample file test.mkv was helpful and is from:
